### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Postdoctoral Scholar at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) working in [Jack Gallant's lab](http://gallantlab.org/). My research currently focuses on applications of the voxelwise modeling framework to clinical research and individual differences.

I received a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience at [Dartmouth](http://pbs.dartmouth.edu), working with [Ida Gobbini](http://haxbylab.dartmouth.edu/ppl/ida.html) and [Jim Haxby](http://haxbylab.dartmouth.edu/ppl/jim.html).
My previous research focused on familiar face perception, using psychophysics and neuroimaging methods (fMRI and MEG) with multivariate techniques (MVPA).

I'm an avid Python user and an enthusiast for open science. In my spare time I enjoy CrossFit, weightlifting, and coffee.
