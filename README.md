### Matteo Visconti di Oleggio Castello, Ph.D.

I'm a Postdoctoral Scholar at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), working in [Jack Gallant's lab](http://gallantlab.org/). 
I'm interested in how our brains build and represent meaning from the world around us. 
My current research focuses on how these representations differ between people.

To study these questions, I build computational models to predict brain activity when we watch movies, listen to stories, or interact with each other.
Then I break these models apart, and see if I can learn something interesting about the brain.

Before coming to Berkeley, I received a Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience at [Dartmouth](http://pbs.dartmouth.edu), working with [Ida Gobbini](http://haxbylab.dartmouth.edu/ppl/ida.html) and [Jim Haxby](http://haxbylab.dartmouth.edu/ppl/jim.html). At Darmouth, I studied how our brains represent the identity of our friends and colleagues. I used psychophysics and fMRI to study familiar face perception.
